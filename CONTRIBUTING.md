# Contributing to Type-DB
ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for your interest in Type-DB and want to contribute to this project !

**All the developement is made in the *development* branch**

Before you begin, you must understand that the Type-DB project is grouped within 3 repositories:
 - [Core](https://github.com/Type-DB/Core)
 - [Server](https://github.com/Type-DB/Server)
 - [Cli](https://github.com/Type-DB/Cli)

You can contribute to the 3 repositories without problem, for this you need to make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and it's gone :D
